## Busketere

Busketere is an app designed to track which subway station a particular busker will be at. A busker has many stations and a station belongs to a busker. The backend was made by your friend Barry, who has it out for one of the other buskers, so you might have to make a few changes.

Here's your goal for this app.

* show a list of all buskers
* clicking on a busker should display the stations they play at
* a user should be able to create a new busker
* a user should be able to delete a busker
* a user should be able to select which station a busker is playing at
* a user should be able to change a busker's name

This requires a little setup. Here's how to get started!

* Clone down both the frontend and backend repositories
* run rails db:create
* run rails db:migrate
* run rails db:seed
* start the Rails server with rails s

The approach you take is up to you! This can be as simple or as difficult as you want, so feel free to approach it however you see fit. I would suggest by getting `get`, `post`, and `delete` working first and then going from there!
